# Lightweight OpenPose Demos

This folder contains sample applications that demonstrate various parts of the functionality provided by the lightweight OpenPose algorithms provided by OpenDR.

More specifically, the following applications are provided:

1. demos/benchmarking_demo.py: A simple benchmarking tool for measuring the performance of lightweight OpenPose in various platforms
2. demos/eval_demo.py: A tool that demonstrates how to perform evaluation using OpenPose
3. demos/inference_demo.py: A tool that demonstrates how to perform inference on a single image and then draw the detected poses
4. demos/webcame_demo.py: A simple tools that performs live pose estimation using a webcam
5. jetbot: A demo developed on Webots to demonstrate how OpenDR functionality can be used to provide a naive fall detector. This demo can be also directly used on an NVIDIA JetBot.
